# py-scraper
Scrapes pure HTML webpages using pyppeteer (puppeteer's Python version). Also can use a proxy list but needs more work when it comes to proxies that require authentication.


## To-do:
  → Format scraped output to search for whatever data the user is looking for (price, items, etc...) - probably with the help of GPT 4.0
  
  → Not use Python because Python is slow
